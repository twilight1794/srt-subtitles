<b>Debbie Gibson - Lost In Your Eyes</b>

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I get lost

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
in your eyes

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,500
and I feel my spirits rise

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,500
and soar like the wind

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:54,000
is it love that I am in?

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I get weak

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in a glance

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,000
isn't that whats called romance?

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,500
and now I know

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
'cause when I'm lost

12
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:21,000
I can't let go

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,000
You can take me to the skies

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,000
It's like being lost in heaven

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,500
when I'm lost in your eyes

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I just fell

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
don't know why

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,500
Somethings there we can't deny

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and when I first knew

21
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:14,000
was when I first looked at you

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
And if I

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,000
can't find my way

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,000
If salvation seems worlds away

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Oh, I'll be found

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:42,000
when I am lost in your eyes

27
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,000
You can take me to the skies

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,000
It's like being lost in heaven

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:10,000
when I'm lost in your eyes

31
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,000
I get weak

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
in a glance

33
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,000
isn't this whats called romance?

34
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, I'll be found

35
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,000
when I am lost

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
in your eyes

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,500
Oh, oh
