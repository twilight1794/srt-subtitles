<b>Bryan Adams - (Everything I Do) I Do It For You</b>

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Look into my eyes, you will see

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What you mean to me

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Search your heart, search your soul

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,850
And when you find me there

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
You’ll search no more

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Don’t tell me it’s not worth trying for

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You can’t tell me it’s not worth dying for

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You know it’s true

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,000
Everything I do, I do it for you

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,400
Look into your heart

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,750
You will find

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There’s nothing there to hide

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Take me as I am, take my life

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,750
I would give it up

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,750
I would sacrifice

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don’t tell me it’s not worth fighting for

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can’t help it, there’s nothing I want more

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You know it’s true

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Everything I do , I do it for you

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There’s no love

22
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,000
Like your love

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,500
And no other could give more love

24
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,000
There’s nowhere unless you’re there

25
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
All the time

26
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,000
All the way

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Look into your heart, baby

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,250
Oh, you can’t tell me it’s not worth trying for

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,000
I can’t help it, there’s nothing I want more

30
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Yeah, I would fight for you

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,500
I’d lie for you

32
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,000
Walk the wire for you

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, I’d die for you

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You know it’s true

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Everything I do

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I do it for you
